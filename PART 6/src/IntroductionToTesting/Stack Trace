When an error occurs in a program, the program typically prints something
called a stack trace, i.e., the list of method calls that resulted in the error.
For example, a stack race might look like this:

Exception in thread "main"...
    at Program.main(Program.java:15)

The type of error is stated at the beginning of the list, and the following line tells
us where the error occurred. The line "at Program.main(Program.java:15)" says that
the error occurred at line number 15 in the Program.java.file
