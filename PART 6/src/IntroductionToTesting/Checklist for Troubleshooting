If your code does not work and you do not know where the error is, these steps
will  help you get started.

    1. Indent your code properly and find out if there are any missing parentheses.
    2. Verify that the variables used are correctly named.
    3. Test the program flow with different inputs and find out the sort of input
    that causes the program to not work as desired. If you received an error in the
    tests, the tests may also indicate the input used.
    4. Add print commands to the program in which you print out the values of the
    variables used at various stages of the program's execution
    5. Verify that all variables you are using initialized. If they aren't, a
    NullPointerException error will occur.
    6. If your program causes an exception, you should definitely pay attention to the
    stack trace associated with the exception, which is the list of method calls
    that resulted in the situation caused the exception
    7. Learn how to use the debugger.
